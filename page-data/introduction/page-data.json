Sometimes is good to find a place where you can organize your thoughts, ideas and be able to run into it when you need it. How many times do you find yourself thinking: “Where did I read that? I can’t remember… I should’ve wrote it down back there…“. Believe me, that happens more frequently than we’re willing to accept.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Well, that’s this whole book idea. Really. I’ll put any information that I find useful. If you find it too, share it, open an issue, I’ll gladly review it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>My intention is to keep up to date with the new technologies and contents that are <del>thrown at</del> shown to us everyday.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I’ll keep it simple as possible, attached to the core ideas and with useful snippets. Is the content still unclear? Well, pretty much everything that I read about programming (tools, concepts, ideas, etc). I know that the scope is really broad, but I’ve to start somewhere.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I think is interesting to share that writing something (a blog post, an note or even a book) is a good way to learn. Seriously. While we write, we put a lot of effort in organize our thoughts and express ourselves in a way that at least makes sense (I’m not sure if I succeeded the way I wanted).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Since this book is about my notes and I’ll keep learning as far and as much as I can, it’ll never be finished.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>People don’t know me as a serious guy (to be honest, they don’t know me at all), so expect some jokes along the way (I’ll do my best, <del>or not, who knows?</del>).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Ah, I almost forgot: I’m not a native English speaker (you probably noticed that by now as you read some <del>terrible</del> mistakes <del>that made your eyes bleed</del>). If you find anything wrong, <del>keep it the way it’s</del> don’t be shy, notify me. I’m here to learn, like everyone else.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I guess it’s enough for the introduction. Let’s get started!</p>\n</blockquote>","frontmatter":{"title":"Introduction","date":"December 29, 2019","description":"A brief introduction extracted from my unreleased book"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/introduction/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/hello-world/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Hello, World!"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/redux/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Redux"}}}}}
